# Datascience Portfolio 

This portfolio present some datascience projects I did. 
To see how I turn models into applications (mobile apps, chatbots, IoT,..) please visit my website.

- [Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram](HR_diagram/HR_diagram.ipynb): One of my favorite study. I took some stars data coming from space agency and tried to verify if stars are following the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram and to identify in which sequence they are. I like to process space data :) 
- [Super Heroes](super_heroes/super_heroes.ipynb): Some data analysis  on super heroes to see if we are more evil heroes on Marvel or DC, how many feminine heroes we got on both, what are the most widespread powers, etc..
- [Hotel Rating](hotel_rating/hotel_rating.ipynb): Trying to predict the rate of an hotel based on comments let by customers on the tripadvisor application.
- [Blood Pressure Project](blood_pressure/blood_pressure.ipynb): Analysis of the most significant parameters between age, weight, body surface area, duration of hypertension, pulse rate and level of stress of patients to explain high blood pressure.
- [Salary Estimation](salary_estimation/salary_estimation.ipynb): Verify is the salary mentionned by a person was true or not. Based on position salaries of the company we will see if this employee is honest or not.

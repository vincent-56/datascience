# Datascience Portfolio 

This portfolio present several of my different datascience projects. 
These use-cases are grouped in two categories which are important to master when you do datascience:
1. Extracting insights from raw data and presenting those insights to others.
2. Building systems that offer direct value to others (customers, your organization, etc...)

## Extracting insights from raw data and presenting those insights to others :
- [Blood Pressure Project](blood_pressure.ipynb): The objective of this project was to determine the most significant parameters between age, weight, body surface area, duration of hypertension, pulse rate and level of stress of patients to explain high blood pressure.
- [Salary Project](hr_salary.ipynb): The objective of this project was to determine if the salary mentionned by a person was true or not. Based on position salaries of the company we will see if this employee is honest or not.
 
## Building systems that offer direct value to others
